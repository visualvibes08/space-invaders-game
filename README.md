# 🚀 Space Invaders - My First Python Game Project

This is a simple **Space Invaders** game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
It marks my very first complete project, through which I started exploring game development and Python graphics programming.

## 🎮 About the Game

In this game, you control a spaceship that can move left or right and fire bullets to destroy incoming enemies.  
The goal is to score as many points as possible by hitting enemies — if they reach the bottom, it's game over!

## ✨ Features

Along with the basic gameplay, I’ve added several new features to enhance the experience:

- 🔁 **Restart button** after Game Over  
- 📂 **High Score system** (stored in a file)  
- 🎵 **Custom Game Over sound**  
- 🎶 **Background music and sound effects**

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Left Arrow** – Move Left  
- **Right Arrow** – Move Right  
- **Spacebar** – Fire Bullet (Only one bullet at a time)

## 🙌 Final Note

I had a lot of fun building this project and learning how to work with **Pygame**, file handling, sound effects, and basic game logic.  
This project helped me take my first step into coding interactive games — and it’s just the beginning!
